Typescript: it is superset of Javascript that adds static typing to help  catch erros during 
code creation rather than at runtime.
Datatypes: string,boolean,number etc
Special Datatypes: any, unknown,never

never: it is a type that represents the the type of values that never occur.
It is used to indicate that something never happens or should never happen.

1) Functions that never return(always throw error or got into infinite loop)
2) type guards that never pass type checking.




Overloading Rules:
1) Only 1 implementation for multiple methods
2)implementation signature must be compatible with all overloads
3) Overloads are compile time only, not runtime
